"One reason is historic.
In the past, companies considered information about their employees to be proprietary, in part to protect themselves from other companies extending unsolicited job offers to their staffs.
But with the frequency at which people change jobs today, that concern is no longer relevant.
And cloistering business data is antiquated thinking."

Stern expressed concern that proposed legislation and regulations, while appropriately protecting personal and behavioral information, could lead to a restriction in the flow of business information and hinder businesses' ability to conduct commerce.
He said that ZoomInfo hopes to open a dialogue among B2B industry organizations and that others will adopt the manifesto and join its effort to assure that businesses have the highly accessible and accurate information they need.

Stern said: "Data that's incorrect causes just as much lost productivity as data that's unavailable.

October 25, 2004 - Currently founder and CEO of Eliyon Technologies Corporation, a spin-off from CardScan, Jonathan Stern has spent a lifetime attempting to replicate human decision-making processes with technology.
Ben Bradley, contributing writer, recently sat down with Jonathan Stern for a conversation about failure and customer expectations.

STERN: I am originally from Israel where I earned a master's degree in computer science from the Technion, Israel's equivalent to MIT.

STERN: Not asking the right question.

STERN: We designed and built one of the most powerful and flexible diagnostic systems, but it was a hard sale, with long sales cycle and a high degree of customization.

STERN: After I left, we ended up selling the company to another enterprise that offers a larger basket of "field service solutions.

STERN: I continue to innovate and come up with new product ideas that are based on machine intelligence.

STERN: Go to market as early as you can and focus your energies on getting paying customers who will make you cashflow positive.

Cirino and Stern, two founders of Boston area tech companies, each raised money from venture capital firms headquartered on the West Coast.

Stern, the founder of ZoomInfo, a Cambridge search company that until recently was known as Eliyon Technologies, says he wasn't trying to raise money last year.
But Vulcan Capital, a Seattle-based VC firm, was kind enough to offer.
"It's like the famous joke," he says.

Jonathan sees an emerging trend in the search industry that will benefit recruiters as well.
In the past, search engines have indexed pages based on keywords, forcing us all to slog through hundreds of entries to find the information we really need.
In the future, search engines will allow users to be more interactive, enabling us to drill down to criteria, not just key words.
Some of this interactivity has already begun with Wikis and tools like ZoomInfo that don't just catalogue the web, but actually understand it and make it faster and easier for you to search ... and find.

Jonathan also sees an increase of business-to-business commerce on the Internet.

But heading Corex, maker of business card scanner CardScan, and Eliyon, a subscription-based database company, hasn't proved unmanageable for the 49-year-old Israeli native.

"My wife pointed out that at Corex I used to get home at 7:30, and now with Eliyon I come home at 7:45," Stern said.
"Funny that you can run another whole company in 15 minutes.
But you have to have a really great team around you."
One of Stern's first teams was the Israeli army, where he spent five years after getting his master's degree in computer science from Technion, the Israeli Institute of Technology.
He worked in the Intelligence Corps and received a medal for his technical achievements
and contribution to national security.

"(Military service) is a requirement in Israel, so you don't have a lot of choices," Stern said.

clients in the United States, Stern found it impractical to run the company from Israel, moving with his wife to the United States in 1989.

News</Title><Url>http://www.zoominfo.com/About/articles/news_04_21_03.asp</Url><Description>"From a strategic perspective, it's about recruiters penetrating the veil that stands between a company's need for the most suitable top-echelon people ... professionals who otherwise may be engaged in their present jobs and not even be interested in changing employers," Eliyon founder Jonathan Stern said.Finding Leaders Through Technology"Job-seekers don't come to us with their resume," Stern said.Eliyon, the name of which is Hebrew for "superior," was created by Stern and a team of mostly Israeli computer programmers associated with Technion Institute of Technology in Haifa, Israel--the oldest university in Israel and a technical research center not unlike Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which is also in Cambridge.An Israeli army officer before immigrating to the United States some 13 years ago, Stern received a medal from the president of Israel for designing security card-checking technology used in monitoring internal movement of Palestinians and others in Israel.Some 10 years ago, Stern founded Corex Technologies, a Massachusetts-based company calling itself the world's leader in business card scanning.It describes its technology as being able to "read" a business card slid through a hand-held scanner that connects to a personal computer to create a kind of electronic address book accessible via wireless connections anywhere.In February, he signed a deal with Monster, the Maynard, Mass.-based international job referral Web server.While Monster's input comes from resumes and job listings posted actively by individuals and employers, Eliyon's engine works without "human hands," Stern said.From its computer base in Cambridge, Eliyon crawls the Internet endlessly "reading" press releases, newspapers and specialty press, company Web sites, trade and professional association sites, the Securities and Exchange Commission Web filings, court records, alumni publications, charitable and nonprofit listings, and millions of other Internet records to identify individuals likely to be of interest to HR recruiters.Numerous search criteria are involved, starting with job title, work history, company description, education, and geographic location, according to Eliyon.Referencing another popular search engine, Stern said, "Google 'reads' every single page of some three billion Web sites worldwide and then categorizes every single word on every single page.</Description><Date>2003-04-21</Date></WebReference><WebReference><Title>DYMO |
